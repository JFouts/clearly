# Clearly .NET
Clearly .NET is a library that is intended to facilitate Domain Driven Design (DDD) in .Net Core applications. The goal is to abstract the technical details associated with your application so that the application code focuses deeply on the business domain. Clearly can be added to your projects through a series of NuGet packages that are easy to install and configure.
